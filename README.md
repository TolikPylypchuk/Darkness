# Darkness

A maze game where you don't actually see the entire maze.

## How to Play

The start tile is pink and on the left side, and the finish tile is purple and on the right side.

If you're on a laptop, use the keyboard arrow keys to move and turn.

Alternatively, you can click/tap on the maze itself to move. Click/tap on the upper part to move/turn up, on the lower
part - down, on the left part - to the left, right part - to the right.

## Settings

You can configure the maze width and height as well as whether you always see the end tile or not.

## Project Status

While this app is extemely simple and minimalistic, there are many things that can be improved or extended. However,
for now I'm done with it and I'm going to focus on my other projects. Maybe, one day I'll return to it to extend it and
make it better.

I had two goals when creating the app - learn how to use Blazor WebAssembly and create a maze app. I've always liked
creating mazes, and when I started programming this was one of the things I wanted to do. One of the first apps that
I've ever written was a maze app, though it was pretty bad. Now that I've created this app, I feel that I can check this
item off my to-do list.
